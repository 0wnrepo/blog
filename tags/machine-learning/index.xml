      <description>Regression analysis and its relation with Machine Learning Machine learning is the field of study that explores the construction of algorithms that learn from data and can make predictions about it. It is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical methods to give those predictions. And it&amp;rsquo;s name comes from the ability that it gives to computer systems to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.
Machine learning by itself sometimes isn&amp;rsquo;t the best answer, but it can be combined with specialist agents to expand it&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and reduce the training time.</description>
