# What is Artificial Intelligence ?

This is a hard question to ask, because not even among the experts there is a
complete agreement about what defines something as a real **artificial
intelligence.**

So it can be split between *acting* and *"thinking"*, and again between
*humanly* and *rationally*. Before you state that humans are rational, please
look carefully to this gif

So the combination of those aspects generate this four approaches generates:

 - Acting humanly
 - Thinking humanly
 - Thinking rationally
 - Acting rationally

# Acting humanly

Can be considered the characteristic of a computer being able to act and pass as
a human being among others. The concept that a machine can fool a human into
thinking that it is really a human. As proposed by **Turing** in 1950, the
[**Turing test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) is a way to perform
this kind of assertion, if a machine can fool a group of humans into thinking
that they are talking with a human, so this machine can be considered to act in
a similar way to humans.

For the purpose of *intelligence* only, no physical interaction is needed, but
for the **total Turing test** it is, so it can include a video or a physical
construction (a robot basically) to interact with a group of humans. The actual
technology is too primitive to such test be necessary, but when it happens, you
can imagine a scene just like this from the **Blade Runner** movie:

The whole movie is good mental exercise of what a real IA would look like and
all its dilemmas, they just renamed the Turing test to **Voigt-Kampff** test,
but the essence of the test stills the same.
