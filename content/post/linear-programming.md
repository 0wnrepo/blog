**Linear programming** is a mathematical method to achieve the best result for a
given problem. This problem is expressed through a mathematical model which
represents the real world problem. Also called **linear optimization** because
of it's essence to optimize a [*linear objective
function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function).

In other words, linear programming aim to find the optimal input value for the
function, value which will also be the optimal solution for the problem. Usually
linear optimization is a good method to solve [assignment
problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) which are a
fundamental kind of [**combinatorial optimization**
problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization). Assignment
(or allocation) problems are basically the kind of problem that asks for the
allocation of scarce resources. Some examples:

- Determine which items to produce in a factory;

$$
\frac{1}{(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi) e^{\frac25 \pi}} =
     1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}}
      {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\ldots} } } }
$$

$$
X=Y
$$


## Example problem

To make things more concrete, lets try to use an example and solve it. Let's
suppose that a certain farmer wants to know which vegetables to cultivate in his
farm. Let's suppose that the farmer can grow 2 kinds of vegetables, *corn* and
*beans*. And the farmers main objective is the maximum profit.


## Problem modeling

- Variables
- Restrictions
- Objective function


### Objective function

It shows our target function to archive, it can be a **maximization** or
**minimization** of the result of the function $Z$. Also, but not so common, is
try to approximate $Z$ to a certain value.

### Restrictions

Restrictions are any restriction that we need to apply to our variables. The
amount of resources, time, effort, etc... One common restriction considering
cases where we are applying linear programming to production is the **non
negativity** rule, it means, you can't produce -1 cars, all numbers of cars
produced must be positive or no car produced at all (zero cars).
